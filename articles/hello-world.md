Hey! It's **me** ðŸ˜„

Welcome to my new blog! Every time I start a new blog I always think about the content I want to write. I started [laux.es](https://laux.es) 5 years ago to learn about User Experience (UX). In 2015, [irb.rocks](https://irb.rocks/hi_world-rb/) was born to write about Ruby and practice my English. **So, what's the purpose of this blog?**

## My everyday life

**That's all**. I don't plan to focus this blog on a specific language or topic. I just prefer to enjoy writting about the project I'm working, the last videogame I played, my last photography or any personal experiences.

See you in the next post :)
