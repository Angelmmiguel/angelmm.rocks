Hey! It's **me** ðŸ˜„

Welcome to my third blog! Every time I start a new blog I always think about the content I want to write. I started [laux.es](https://laux.es) 5 years ago to learn about User Experience (UX). In 2015, [irb.rocks](https://irb.rocks/hi_world-rb/) was born to write about Ruby and practice my English. **So, what's the purpose of this blog?**

## Me
