_Imagine you are running a small shop in your city. One day you catch someone robbing something in your shop. After arguing, that person asks you to join your shop crew because there are some security points that could be improved._

Probably, you **wouldn't want to hire a robber** for your shop. That individual knows the damage is causing by robbing you, but that's not a reason to stop doing that. Is that the kind of person you would want to work with?

What's happen in the developer's  world?

# Professional ethics

Recently, I read [this article](https://medium.com/@timotheejeannin/i-built-a-screenshot-api-and-some-guy-was-mining-cryptocurrencies-with-it-cd188dfae773) about a man that was using a screenshot API to earn money minning cryptocurrencies. The article talks about how the company managed the situation to stop him.

The conversation was respectful and finnally, the man stopped minning crypto using that service. I don't want to discuss about how the company managed the situation, but I'd like to highligh some parts of the conversation:

> C: Are we the first company you attacked?
>
> M: No..
>
> M: this is my hobby
>
> M: for fun and profit
>
> [...]
>
> M: i am sorry if you had any loss
>
> C: It's ok we haven't lost anything.
>
> [...]
>
> M: can i be a part of your team ?
>
> C: i'm sorry but we already have a developer in house.

We're at the same point than the shop example. **A person without professional ethics that knows the damage he or she might causes to your company is asking to join your team**. He knows how to use your service illicitly, so he knows how to protect you. 

Based on the comments of the [article](https://medium.com/@timotheejeannin/i-built-a-screenshot-api-and-some-guy-was-mining-cryptocurrencies-with-it-cd188dfae773), it seems the company was wrong. But, was they really wrong ignoring his offering?

**No**.

Ethics in general ought to be integrated in all your hiring decisions. **Surround yourself with people that helps you to grow as a professional, but even more important, as a person**. Please, don't reward bad people because they are good programmers.

# Mentors and idols

The same principle applies to your mentors and idols. Remember, ethics matters and are very important. If you know that your idols are a good professionals but completely awful people, don't promote their work. 

You may think that it doesn't matter because their opinions are not relevant for their work. **However, increasing their popularity has a dangerous consequence**. Their ideas will become more popular too.

**Please create a better community promoting good people, not good developers**.
