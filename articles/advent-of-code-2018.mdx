[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) is an initiative to practice coding during Deccember. To try a new language, prepare for a job interview or just have fun programming are good excuses to join it.

The way it works is pretty simple: **every day you'll receive a challenge and an input and you'll need to provide an output**. There's a global [leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard) where you can compare with other people or create a private one with your friends, as I did.

About the code, I've created [a repository](https://github.com/Angelmmiguel/adventcode2018) where all my friends and me will be pushing the challenges. Feel free to check it!

# My TOTRY list

I love to try new things. Every library or language I try give me a wider view in programming. For these kind of challenges I always try to learn something out of my comfort zone. So, these are some of the languages I would like to try during December:

* [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/)

Let's see how far I get using these languages ðŸ˜‚
